Have you ever felt that these modern games are too complicated? I mean, GUIs? Graphics? What's going on with all that?
Well, worry no more, and look no further, because I have the perfect thing for you! A text-based """rogue-like""" where you explore a dungeon filled with goodies, traps, and enemies.
How long can you survive? Can you escape? Don't hesitate to find out!

This is a simple text-based explorer game made entirely in Java as my introduction to the language! Hopefully the game works and you don't experience any crashes. Is the game good? I hope you think so! Is my code good? NO! And I wouldn't expect it to be.
